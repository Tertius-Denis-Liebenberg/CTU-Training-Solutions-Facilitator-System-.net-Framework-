# CTU Training Solutions Facilitator System

CTU Training Solutions has tasked us with creating a capturing system for their facilitators using ASP.NET MVC5. The system allows facilitators to manage student information, including adding new students, editing student details, viewing student details, and deleting students when necessary. The system incorporates CTU's branding by using their colors (maroon and light grey) and their logo. All information is stored, retrieved, and updated in an SQL database.

## Features

- **User Authentication:**
  - Facilitators can register and login to the system.
  - Upon successful login, they gain access to manipulate the system.

- **Student Management:**
  - Add new students to the system.
  - Edit student details.
  - View details of each student.
  - Delete students who drop out or deregister.
